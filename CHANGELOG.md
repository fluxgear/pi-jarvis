# Changelog

This changelog tracks the documented release history of this project. Earlier entries were reconstructed from the repository's release tags where fuller notes were not preserved at release time.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

> Historical note: releases before the `pi-jarvis` 1.x line refer to the project's earlier `pi-btw` and `/btw` naming. Those entries are preserved as historical release records and do not describe the current product name or command surface.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- Reduced the default npm install footprint by keeping Pi host packages and `pi-mcp-adapter` as optional peer dependencies instead of installing the full Pi/AI/MCP dependency stack with `pi-jarvis`.

### Changed
- Documented optional MCP adapter behavior and added package-manifest regression coverage for the lightweight install contract.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- Added `/jarvis-thinking` with project/global `auto`, `follow-main`, explicit thinking-level, and `clear` settings so `/jarvis` thinking can be configured independently from the main session.
- Added side-session handling for `/compact`, `/tree`, and `/new` when those commands are entered inside `/jarvis`.

### Changed
- Documented the `/jarvis-thinking` and side-session `/compact`/`/tree`/`/new` command behavior and expanded regression coverage for thinking config precedence, runtime sync, xAI forced-off behavior, and side-session command routing.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- Prevented stale in-flight `/jarvis` boots from surviving `session_shutdown` / `session_start` and reattaching an obsolete side-session runtime after a session restart.
- Kept plain-string assistant turns visible in the recent main-session transcript context instead of collapsing the recent window to `none`.
- Made `/jarvis` fail closed when the newest stored side-session ref is malformed instead of silently reconnecting to an older session file.
- Preserved the speaker label when the overlay transcript is clipped mid-entry and stripped raw terminal control sequences from rendered transcript content.
- Added a shared `.gitignore` rule for project-local `.pi/` artifacts so fresh clones do not accidentally commit `.pi/jarvis.json`.

### Changed
- Documented the no-argument `/jarvis-model` picker path and the bridge-tool compatibility gate in the shipped README/AGENTS docs.
- Expanded regression coverage for stale boot invalidation, malformed newest session refs, plain-string assistant context extraction, overlay clipping, overlay control-sequence sanitization, and `.pi/` ignore hygiene.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- Made `/jarvis` report MCP availability from the actual loaded tool set instead of extension-path discovery alone, so non-MCP extension paths no longer surface a false `MCP available` state.

### Changed
- Added regression coverage for the non-MCP extension-path case, shipped `AGENTS.md` in the published package surface, and aligned the README package-contents section with the actual npm tarball.
- Marked the stale phase-02 and next-session prompt files as historical implementation artifacts instead of live product guidance.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- Hardened `/jarvis` state and overlay behavior by recognizing `npm pack --dry-run` as validation, avoiding false `done` summaries after passing validation alone, bounding latest-message refresh to post-compaction entries, preserving concurrent anonymous same-name tool activity, and keeping confirmation/footer content visible on short terminal heights.
- Improved `/jarvis-model` recovery by letting `clear` remove malformed scoped config files and by falling back between project and global settings independently when one layer is malformed.
- Tightened overlay transcript sanitization so multiline leaked tool-routing payloads are stripped while legitimate assistant content remains visible.

### Changed
- Added regression coverage for malformed config recovery, short-height confirmation rendering, package-manifest contract checks, and the new state/runtime edge cases covered by the audit sweep.
- Marked stale phase/versioned prompts as historical implementation artifacts and clarified the legacy `/btw` naming in the changelog history.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- Added layered `/jarvis` model settings with project overrides in `.pi/jarvis.json`, global defaults in `~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-jarvis.json`, and fallback to built-in `follow-main`.

### Changed
- Updated `/jarvis-model` to support scoped `--project` and `--global` writes plus `clear` semantics for falling back through the config layers.
- Replaced the prior branch-scoped `/jarvis` model persistence with explicit config-backed precedence and refreshed the regression coverage and README.

## [1.1.5] - 2026-04-19

### Changed
- Added the `pi-package` and `extension` keywords so `pi-jarvis` is discoverable by the `pi.dev` package index.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- Fixed `/jarvis` overlay transcript leakage and redraw polish.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-17

### Changed
- Finished `/jarvis` awareness and overlay polish.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- Stabilized `/jarvis` overlay behavior by sanitizing inherited main-agent workflow policy.
- Kept the polished `Thinking...` fallback animation and removed inconsistent structured thinking-step rendering.
- Updated regression coverage for overlay/runtime behavior.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-07

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-06

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- Added main-session summary context builders.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- Initial public release of `pi-btw`, a Pi extension that opens a `/btw` side-conversation overlay inside the active Pi session.
- Persistent side-session storage and restoration for `/btw` conversations.
- Main-model synchronization so `/btw` follows the current Pi model selection.
- Automated type-check and regression test coverage.

### Changed
- Added live main-session state capture as groundwork for future context-aware `/btw` behavior without replaying the full transcript.
